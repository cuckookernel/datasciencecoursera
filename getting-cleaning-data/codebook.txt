Codebook output dataset 

Columns should be interpreted according to the following

*subject* : numeric id of the person on which measurements where made
*activity* :  activity being performed, possible values are "WALKING", 
                                   "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING",
                                   "STANDING","LAYING"

In the measurement columns, we use the following conventions:

*mean* : mean of the samples for this measurement
*std* : std deviation of the sample for this measurement

*time...* : measurement in the time domain
*freq...* : measurement in the frequency domain, i.e. after Fourier transform

*Ang.Velocity* : Angular velocity 

All angular velocities are in units of 1/s  (second^-1)
Accelarations are in units of 1/s^2
Jerks are in units of 1/s^3
